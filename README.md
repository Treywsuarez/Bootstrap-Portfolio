# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This project is my second but upgraded bootcamp portfolio. I will use this project to show case my portofolio works from my bootcamp experience. 

To create this portfolio I used HTML5, CSS and bootstrap.

HTML5 was used to create the layout of the webpage along with my different sections. CSS was used to style each section and to create css varaibles for global changes. Bootstrap was used to easily create different sections and add easy to use/customizable structures.
